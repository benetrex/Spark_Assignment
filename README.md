# Big Data Evaluation using PySpark on files in Hadoop File System
## Connection to Spark and HDFS
Spark connection is realized using PySpark. To be able to connect to Spark, run this notebook on your master node, where spark is installed. 
<br>
As Python 3 is used, make sure all your slave nodes are running Python 3 as well.<br>

The HDFS connection has been realized using PyArrow

Numpy and Matplotlib are being used for data visualization purposes

The notebook is currently used to evaluate sensor data gathered from an Arduino
